# knock-offPokeMole
Come back Pikachu
Haven’t contribute much on group project. So I stole those codes and put up a testing mole game that is 70% working. 
 1) music won’t play on its own, need to click it manually then click start and the game end around the  music end.
2) formatting issues. Background doesn’t fit depends on browsers. 
3) the fake moles ( fake “pikachu” ) suppose to have a negative score, but idk how, so they are just there for nothing. Regular mole/Pikachu has +1 score when click on forehead. 
4) it isn’t total random, cause I assigned fake moles to specific grass space.
